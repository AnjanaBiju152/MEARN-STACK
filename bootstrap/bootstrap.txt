Bootsrap Grid system
=======================
The grid system in Bootstrap is a responsive, mobile-first layout grid that
 - allows developers to structure the layout of a web page or application. 
 It's based on a 12-column grid layout system, which provides
 flexibility and control over how content is displayed across 
 different screen sizes and devices.
- The grid system is divided into 12 columns, which can be used to create 
 various layouts. Developers can specify how many columns each element 
 should occupy on different screen sizes 
 (such as extra small, small, medium, large, and extra large).
